# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
  The purpose of this Analysis is to showcase the relationship between the type of cities. The number of drivers and riders. As well as percentage of   total fares, drivers and riders by city type. To improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for under served areas.
  
  ## Results
The cities in this analysis are classified into 3 demographical types Rural, Uran and Suburban. The data shows that The urban cities have 1,625     rides and 2,405 drivers. which is significantly more than the other cities. Rural city type have 125 total rides and 78 drivers. Suburban city type   has 625 rides and 490 drivers. The graph below shows the percentage of the rides by city type as well as the percentage of the total fares by city type.

The Analyzed data also shows that the Rural city drivers earn more than the suburban and Urban drivers. Rural drivers earn on average $55 which is approximatelt $16 more than suburban drivers and $39 more than Urban drivers. Whereas Suburban drivers comes in second earning on average $39 which is approximately $23 more than Urban drivers. Urban drivers comes in last earning on average $17. 

There is a significant difference in the total number of drivers as well as the total rides. Urban cities have 1625 drivers, 1000 more than suburban cities and 1500 more than Rural cities. You will notice in the chart below that the total fares are more in the urban cities and the average fare ride is more affordable in the urban cites.

## Summary
### Based on the Analyzed Data my Recommendations Are:
  - To re-evaluate the demographic areas that make up the 3 city types balancing the city types to be more even.
  - My second recommendation is for the PyBer App. 
There should be a function to track the number of missed rides. The number of rides and drivers are significantly lower in the rural and suburban area. An analysis should be done allowing a chance to see if there is potential need for more drivers to increase revenue for the company.
As shown in the chart below. The Ride-sharing data from 2019 shows that there can be potential growth and potential increase in rides if the drivers were more spread out.

  - My third recommendation is to allow the drivers to have access to all areas. This will allow drivers in the urban cities a chance to make more money in other cities as well as allowing the Rural and Suburban drivers to pick up more rides in the urban cities. Another positive point in opening the areas to all drivers is reducing the number of missed rides due to more drivers being available in all areas.
